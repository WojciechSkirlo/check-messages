# mCheck

Hi! maybe you wanted to know, how many messages you exchanged with your friend.
I was curious and decided to create an application that let us know that thing.

What you can check:
- Ranking of 100 people which you wrote the most,
- How many messages you wrote to your friend,
- First message date and content,
- Last message date,
- Who started the conversation


## Project Setup

yarn install
```
